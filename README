2.2.2
* Changes to process values after all EnvVars and Configs have been parsed (rmark)

2.2.1
* Small change to environment variable processing order to make config more intuitive

2.2.0
!!!NOTE!!!: Configuration format changes with this release.

* Major refactoring and simplification

* Store a base64-encoded backup of the base environment in the ESHELL_ENV_BACKUP environment variable
** Allows for much saner spawning of new eshells from within an existing shell

* Add the ability to include configs, eg:

  <Include>some/relative/include.xml</Include>
  <Include>%AN_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE%/otherconfig.xml</Include>

* Remove the top-level 'EnvironmentVariables' container, eg:

  <EnvironmentVariables>
    <EnvVar ...>
    <EnvVar ...>
  </EnvironmentVariables>
  
  becomes:
  
  <EnvVar ...>
  <EnvVar ...>

* Remove the 'PathSettings' section of the config
** Instead, you can directly modify the path, eg:

  <EnvVar variableName="PATH" value="%PATH%;/some/new/path" />
  
* Remove the 'PerlSettings' section of the config
** Instead, you can directly set the library paths, eg:

  <EnvVar variableName="PERL5LIB" value="%PERL5LIB%;/some/perl/dir" />

* Remove support for UserSettings.xml
** Instead, users should use the '-set' argument on shortcuts, eg:

  eshell.pl ... -set SOMEVARIABLE=somevalue
  
* Support recursive parentage for configurations
** There used to be a limit to the depth of parentage, no more...

* Add aliases for environment variables, eg:

    <EnvironmentVariableAlias aliasName="code" envVarName="PROJECT_CODE" />
  
  makes:
  
    eshell.pl ... -code blah
    
  equivalent to:
  
    eshell.pl ... -set PROJECT_CODE=blah
